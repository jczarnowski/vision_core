Vision/Core
=============

This is a small collection C++11 classes useful for various computer vision / robotics / GPGPU problems, largely inspired by the Kangaroo library.
Nothing tested properly, most under development, unstable.

## Features
### Buffers
* Buffer1D - linear vector of elements, either Host/CUDA or OpenCL allocators.
* Buffer2D - 2D buffer of elements, either Host/CUDA or OpenCL allocators.
* Buffer3D - 3D buffer of elements, either Host/CUDA or OpenCL allocators.
* BufferPyramid - 2D buffer pyramid, either Host/CUDA or OpenCL allocators.
* CUDATexture - wrapper to see 2D buffer or OpenGL to get CUDA texture access.
* GPUVariable - single element buffer pretty much.
* Image2D - derived from Buffer2D, but adds interpolations and derivatives.
* ImagePyramid - Image2D pyramid.
* ReductionSum2D - 2D reductions CUDA + thrust, up to 4 variables and reductions over pyramids.
* Volume - derived from Buffer3D, but adds interpolations and derivatives.

### Control
* PID - simple PID controller.
* VelocityProfile - Trapezoidal/Constant velocity profile generators.

### Image
* ImagePatch - convenient access to a patch in a Buffer2D.
* PixelConvert - pixel type conversions.

### Math
* Angles - angular quantities utilities + circular mean.
* DenavitHartenberg - robotic joint generator.
* Divergence - divergence operators.
* Fitting - fitting plane to points, circle or transformation.
* HammingDistance - portable Hamming distance (CPU/CUDA).
* Kalman - TBD
* LeastSquares - simple least squares solver.
* LiangBarsky - Liang-Barsky Intersection Test.
* LocalParamSE3 - Sophus::SE3 parametrization for Ceres
* LossFunctions - L1, L2, Huber, Cauchy, Turkey, GermanMcClure and Welsch.
* PolarSpherical - conversions from/to cartesian/polar/spherical coordinate systems.
* Random - simple wrapper over C random functions.
* RANSAC - TBD
* Statistics - running stats on single variables, Eigen or multivariate stats on Eigen types. Pearson product-moment.

### Types
* AxisAlignedBoundingBox - extending Eigen's AlignedBox.
* CostVolumeElement - for plane sweep cost volume.
